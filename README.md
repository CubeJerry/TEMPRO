Nanobody Melting Temperature Prediction using Protein Embeddings

We present a method for estimating a nanobodyâ€™s melting temperature with their protein structure embeddings as predictive features of thermostability using an input fasta file.


**Files:**

1) embedding_generator.zip - contains the code for generating embeddings using ESM and fasta file of all 567 nanobodies used in the study.
   
2) paper_results.zip - contains the codes and necessary datasets to reproduce our results from the paper.
   
3) user.zip - contains our pre-trained models for predicting your own nanobody thermostability.



**Instructions:**

To predict your own nanobody melting temperature using its protein sequence:

1) Please install the required packages using the requirements.txt file such as:
   
   'conda install -r requirements.txt'
   
   or
   
   'pip install -r requirements.txt.'
   
3) Navigate to the user folder, open "TEMPRO.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook, and run the codes.
