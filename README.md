# TEMPRO
Nanobody Melting Temperature Prediction using Protein Embeddings


Protein language models in current literature are of growing interest in contexts of protein stability changes, protein sequencing/scaffold filling, and other biophysical property predictions. Recently, protein sequence's numerical representations or embeddings have been used for protein engineering, such as predicted solubility, thermophilicity, and other property prediction or classification tasks. We present a method estimating a nanobodyâ€™s melting temperature using their protein structure embeddings as predictive features of thermostability.


To reproduce and/or predict your own nanobody melting temperature using its protein sequence:
1) Please install the required packages using the requirements.txt file such as:
   
   'conda install -r requirements.txt'
   or
   'pip install -r requirements.txt.'
   
2) Navigate to the user folder, open "TEMPRO.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook, and run the codes.


Upon use, please cite our paper:
