Nanobody Melting Temperature Prediction using Protein Embeddings

We present a method for estimating a nanobodyâ€™s melting temperature with their protein structure embeddings as predictive features of thermostability using an input fasta file.


**Files:**

1) embedding_generator.zip - contains the code for generating embeddings using ESM and fasta file of all 567 nanobodies used in the study (we will insert the Zenodo link here for larger files upon publication).
   
2) paper_results.zip - contains the codes and necessary datasets to reproduce our results from the paper.
   
3) user.zip - contains our pre-trained models for predicting your own nanobody thermostability.



**Instructions:**

To predict your own nanobody melting temperature using its protein sequence:

1) Please install the required packages using the requirements.txt file such as:
   
   'conda install -r requirements.txt'
   
   or
   
   'pip install -r requirements.txt.'
   
3) Navigate to the user folder, open "TEMPRO.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook, and run the codes.


Upon use, please cite our paper:


Notes for reproducing paper results (inside paper_results.zip file):
1) "sdab_data.xlsx" is the processed dataset containing all 567 single-domain antibodies used for the analyses.
2) "raw_nbthermo_json_data.csv" contains the raw sdab data from NbThermo database.
3) "raw_nrl_data.xlsx" contains the raw sdab data manually curated by the authors.
